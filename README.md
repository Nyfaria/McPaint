# MC Paint
Experience the MSPaint feeling in minecraft. With MCPaint, you can paint most blocks and draw cool art on them.

The mod adds one item, a brush. It can be crafted like a pickaxe but with wool instead of your pickaxe material at the top. Right-click any block with the brush and a editor will pop up where you can paint it! The resolution can be changed from 8x8 up to 128x128 for a single block.
